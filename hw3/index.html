                        [As taken from 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life</a>]

                        <br><br>
                        "The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite 
                        two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each 
                        of which is in one of two possible states, alive or 
                        dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated" (the difference 
                        may seem minor, except when viewing it as an early 
                        model of human/urban behaviour simulation or how one 
                        views a blank space on a grid). Every cell interacts 
                        with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are 
                        horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At 
                        each step in time, the following transitions occur:
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
                            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </strong>

                        The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 
                        The first generation is created by applying the above 
                        rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed--births 
                        and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete 
                        moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick 
                        (in other words, each generation is a pure function of 
                        the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied 
                        repeatedly to create further generations."

                        <br>
                        <strong>However,</strong> this game is a little 
                        different. The player is allowed to toggle 12 cells in 
                        total. They can choose to use
                        all 12 cells in the beginning to make a pattern, or 
                        they may choose to only allocate some and keep the rest 
                        for later. After creating a
                        pattern, the player can press the "play" button to 
                        begin the Game of Life. The Game of Life will only 
                        proceed through 60 cycles before
                        the round is over. At any point, the player may choose 
                        to "pause" the game and toggle cells, given that they 
                        have toggleable cells left, from live to dead or dead 
                        to live. Once the 60 cycles are over, the round is done.  
                        <br><br>

                        For each live cell (black cell) your pattern generates, 
                        your score increases by 1. For each cell that dies 
                        (white cell), your score decreases by 1. The end score
                        recorded, if the player chooses to save their score, 
                        will be the maximum score achieved in the round. For 
                        fun, the number of unique cells populated during the 
                        round is also tracked and recorded.
